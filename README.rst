Warping board path length calculator
====================================

This repo is the beginnings of a tool to calculate the lengths of
paths on a warping board.  What's a warping board?  It's a tool used
by weavers to measure lengths of yarn before you thread it through a
loom and weave it into cloth.  If you're curious you can see a picture
of one in `this Instructible`_.  One day this code might become part
of a full-blown weaving tool, but right now it's just a random script
you have to edit.  Have fun!
